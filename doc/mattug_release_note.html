%% Release Notes of MatTuGames
% 
%% About Version 1.8
% 
% Release Date: 31-Jan-2020
% 
% SUMMARY
% A major highlight of Version 1.8 is the implementation of a set
% 
% of functions to compute the modified and proper modified
% 
% pre-kernel of a game. In this respect, the axiomatization of
% 
% these solutions and of the modiclus has been implemented.
% 
% In addition, some functions have modified. Finally, some minor 
% 
% bugs were fixed. 
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.7.5
% 
% Release Date: 22-Jan-2019
% 
% SUMMARY
% A major highlight of Version 1.7.5 is the implementation of a set
% 
% of functions to compute the modiclus as well as the simplified
% 
% (pre-)nucleolus and simplified (pre-)kernel of a game.  Furthermore, 
% 
% a set of functions to compute a minimum cost spanning has been added. 
% 
% Some minor bugs were fixed. 
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.7 
% 
% Release Date: 24-Apr-2018
% 
% SUMMARY
% The functions to compute the (pre-)nucleolus/kernel and the
% 
% associated function set of third party solvers like CPLEX, GUROBI
% 
% and MOSEK have been modified. Some minor bug fixes.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.6
% 
% Release Date: 21-Dec-2015
% 
% SUMMARY
% The set of graphical functions has been extended, for instance,
% 
% the core-cover, and some kernel catchers can now be plotted. The
% 
% anti-core functions have been revised, and are more robust. A
% 
% simplex projection method from 4-d into 3-d has been added.
% 
% Some minor bug fixes. 
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.5
% 
% Release Date: 06-Apr-2015
% 
% SUMMARY
% All functions that are using the linprog command from
% 
% Matlab's Optimization Toolbox apply now a dual-simplex method.
% 
% As a consequence, these functions are not anymore backward compatible.
% 
% Some minor bug fixes.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.4
% 
% Release Date: 06-Mar-2015
% 
% SUMMARY
% Extended the graphical capabilities of the toolbox by adding
% 
% some new function.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.3
% 
% Release Date: 03-Nov-2014
% 
% SUMMARY
% Complete code revision of the function ShapleyValue. It is
% 
% now in average ten times faster, but needs more memory. Added new
% 
% graphic functions and some code revision for the old ones.
% 
% They require now the Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3, and their behavior have
% 
% changed. Finally, a set of new functions has been added and some
% 
% bugs were fixed.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.2
% 
% Release Date: 02-Oct-2013
% 
% SUMMARY
% Some code optimization for the Shapley value functions. 
% 
% Performance increase is about 15 percent. A set of new
% 
% functions were added to compute fairness or related values like
% 
% Aumann-Dreze, Owen, Myerson, position, solidarity and coalition
% 
% solidarity value. Moreover, some functions to replicate the 
% 
% Shapley value for related games are incorporated. In addition,
% 
% two new subclass objects have been added. Some functions and
% 
% methods have been modified as well as some bugs have been fixed. 
% 
% The documentation has been revised and updated.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.1
% 
% Release Date: 04-Jun-2013
% 
% SUMMARY
% Code revision of the pre-kernel functions. The evaluation is in average
% 
% 30 times faster than under the previous version. A set of new
% 
% functions were added to compute the pre-nucleolus, nucleolus and
% 
% the kernel. To increase the set of available solvers various interfaces to
% 
% third party solvers have been added. Moreover, to assist the user
% 
% in relative complex and comprehensive game investigations the
% 
% class object TuGame with several subclasses was designed.
% 
% Finally, the code of many functions have been modified and some bugs 
% 
% have been fixed, see below for the details.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.0.2
% 
% Release date: 03-Apr-2012
% 
% SUMMARY
% Updated installation instruction
% 
% Revised documentation
% 
% A boundary value corrected in CddPreKernel.m
