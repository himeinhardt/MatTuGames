% 
% The game theoretical *MATLAB* toolbox *MatTuGames* provides more than 700 
% functions for modeling, and calculating some solutions as well as properties 
% of cooperative games with transferable utilities. In particular, the toolbox 
% provides functions to compute the (pre-)kernel, (pre-)nucleolus, anti (pre-)kernel, 
% and modiclus as well as game values like the Banzhaf, Myerson, Owen, position, 
% Shapley, solidarity, coalition solidarity, Chi, Tau, Gately, or Equal Collective 
% Gains value and much more. In addition, it provides interfaces to *Matlab's 
% Parallel Computing Toolbox* to benefit from a gain in performance by launching 
% supplementary Matlab workers. Moreover, it offers interfaces to third party 
% linear and convex solvers for computing cooperative solution concepts. Besides, 
% it even provides an interface to call our *Mathematica* package *TuGames* within 
% a running Matlab session.
