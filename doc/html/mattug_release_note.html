% cost 
% 
% spanning game has been completely overhauled, and some new routines to study 
% 
% this game class were enclosed. Finally, some minor bugs were fixed.

% 
% SUMMARY
% A major highlight of Version 1.8 is the implementation of a set
%

% 
% of functions to compute the modiclus as well as the simplified
% 
% (pre-)nucleolus and simplified (pre-)kernel of a game.  Furthermore, 
% 
% a set of functions to compute a minimum cost spanning has been added.

% 
% Release Date: 06-Apr-2015
% 
% SUMMARY
% All functions that are using the linprog command from
% 
% Matlab's Optimization Toolbox apply now a dual-simplex method.
% 
% As a consequence, these functions are not anymore backward compatible.
% 
% Some minor bug fixes.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.4

% 
% SUMMARY
% Complete code revision of the function ShapleyValue. It is
% 
% now in average ten times faster, but needs more memory. Added new
% 
% graphic functions and some code revision for the old ones.
% 
% They require now the Multi-Parametric Toolbox 3, and their behavior have
% 
% changed. Finally, a set of new functions has been added and some
% 
% bugs were fixed.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.2
% 
% Release Date: 02-Oct-2013
% 
% SUMMARY
% Some code optimization for the Shapley value functions. 
%

% 
% Aumann-Dreze, Owen, Myerson, position, solidarity and coalition
% 
% solidarity value. Moreover, some functions to replicate the 
% 
% Shapley value for related games are incorporated. In addition,
% 
% two new subclass objects have been added. Some functions and
% 
% methods have been modified as well as some bugs have been fixed. 
% 
% The documentation has been revised and updated.
% 
% 
%% About Version 1.1
% 
% Release Date: 04-Jun-2013
% 
% SUMMARY
% Code revision of the pre-kernel functions. The evaluation is in average
% 
% 30 times faster than under the previous version. A set of new
% 
% functions were added to compute the pre-nucleolus, nucleolus and
% 
% the kernel. To increase the set of available solvers various interfaces to
% 
% third party solvers have been added. Moreover, to assist the user
% 
% in relative complex and comprehensive game investigations the
% 
% class object TuGame with several subclasses was designed.
% 
% Finally, the code of many functions have been modified and some bugs 
% 
% have been fixed, see below for the details.
